                         <p>The summer of 2020 saw a monumental loss on the grounds of Copperbelt University, as the revered and elegant Mafishi, a giant of the Mafishi species, ascended to a greater pond.
His passing cast a long shadow on the student body, for Mafishi was an academic inspiration and a vibrant thread in the tapestry of campus life.</p>

<p> In the wake of this mysterious tragedy, on August 28th, 2020, the students of CBU erupted in a chorus of protest, their voices filling the airwaves of local and international media.
Even former President Edgar Lungu offered his condolences in the face of this immense loss.</p>
                            
                                <p>The government's swift response came in the form of two new exotic fish, Mafishi #2 and Natasha, destined to take their place in the university's aquatic community, while the original Mafishi's remains found solace in the museum.
Research whispers through the halls of CBU that "Mafishi" signifies a 5th-year student, the seasoned veterans of campus life, while "Fresher" marks the bright-eyed newbies.
These 5th-year giants stalk the campus with a majestic swagger, a testament to their seniority,
and Mafishi, the original king of the pond, once sauntered from Mingling Center to Computer Center, 
a living emblem of their reign.**</p>
                   

<p>His remarkable journey began in 2001, and had he remained among us, this year would have marked his 23rd birthday.
Students fondly recall the calming presence of Mafishi, a silent balm for stressed souls facing the pressures of schoolwork, exams, and presentations.
"Just watching him," they say, "would melt the tension away."</p>

<p>May his soul forever bask in the peaceful depths of eternity.</p>

                            <p> Prominent International and award winning photographer, Cornelius Mulenga popular known as Chellah Tukuta believe Macky 2 is better than Slapdee. In his own words he said Slapdee is superb, but his pride kills everything.

Chellah Tukuta has been using his large social media platform for a lot of good lately. Including promoting Zambian artists.

However, when it came to Slapdee today the celebrity photographer did not have a lot of kind words to say.

He compared Slapdee to an artist of equal status Macky 2. About Macky2 he said;
</p>
                      
<p> 
“Macky2 will go down in history for helping lift up upcoming artists.” He referred to Macky2 as a living legacy for impacting young people. And also said his humility will keep him on top for a long time.

However, when it came to Slapdee, Chellah Tukuta said;


                          </p>

                          <p> 
                            “Slapdee is very talented and very good with his style of music, but his pride kills everything.”

He further alleged that Slapdee wants all the glory on himself and doesn’t want to share the glory.


                          </p>

                             

                        <p> 

                            Slapdee has not responded, but Chellah has faced the wrath of the hip-hop artists fans. Many have called Chellah out for
                             not helping upcoming photographers.

             <h2>Best apples to eat? Healthiest types from green to red and everything in between</h2>
             <hr> 
                <p> Apples are a classic fruit choice. They're the unofficial mascot of lunchbox side dishes and they make a delicious afternoon snack when dipped in peanut butter. They're even available at McDonald’s as a healthy Happy Meal side.

It’s no surprise then that the U.S. is one of the world’s largest apple producers, second only to China. We produce an average of 240 million bushels of apples every year, according to the U.S. Apple Association.

But with so many varieties to choose from, is there one that reigns supreme? Here’s what we found out about the nutritional profiles of the different kinds of apples.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2> What is the healthiest apple?</h2>
                <hr> 
                <p> Whether it’s Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp or Gala; any type of apple is going to benefit your health. Only 12.3% of American adults meet their fruit intake recommendations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. The more apples in your diet, the better,
                  
                   says registered dietitian Danielle Crumble Smith, regardless of the type.</p>
                    <hr>   
                     <p> Some, however, have unique health benefits.
               <hr> 
Red Delicious apples are the healthiest from an antioxidant standpoint, Crumble Smith says. The darker the color of the apple, the richer it’ll be in antioxidants. Antioxidants help neutralize the free radicals in our bodies which, when imbalanced, can cause cell damage and lead to disease.

“Aiming for different types of deep colors can help ensure that you’re getting a variety of different types of antioxidants,” she says.</p>
<p> If you’re looking to increase your vitamin C intake, try a Pink Lady or McIntosh apple, Crumble Smith says. If fiber is what you seek, go for a Honeycrisp or Granny Smith. 

Across the board with apples one thing's for sure, Crumble Smith says, eat them raw and unpeeled.

“Eating the skin ensures that you’re really going to get all of that fiber, get all of those antioxidants because the skin is where a lot of it is,” Crumble Smith says. The vitamin C content 
can also decrease during the cooking process because vitamin C is soluble in water and sensitive to temperature.</p>

              <h2>The True Story Of The Real Annabelle Doll</h2>
                 <p> Though she doesn’t share the same porcelain skin and lifelike features as her cinematic counterpart,
                    the Annabelle doll that lives in the Occult Museum of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, 
                    the pair that worked on the case, is made all the more creepy by how ordinary she appears.</p>
                    <p> Annabelle’s stitched features, including her half-smile and bright orange triangular nose, evoke memories of childhood toys and simpler times.

          <div class="blog3"> 
         <p>   If you could ask Ed and Lorraine Warren (though Ed died in 2006 and Lorraine died in early 2019), they would tell you that the stark warnings scrawled across Annabelle’s glass case are more than necessary.

According to the well-known paranormal investigators, the doll is responsible for two near-death experiences, 
one fatal accident, and a string of demonic activities that lasted some 30 years.</p>

                 <p> The first of these infamous hauntings can allegedly be traced back to 1970, when Annabelle was brand new. The story was told to the Warrens by two young women and was retold for years after by the Warrens themselves.

As the story goes, the Annabelle doll had been a gift to a young nurse named Donna (or Deirdre, depending on the source) from her mother for her 28th birthday. Donna, apparently thrilled with the gift, brought it back to her apartment that she shared with another young nurse named Angie.

At first, the doll was an adorable accessory, sitting on a sofa in the living room and greeting visitors with her colorful visage. But before long, the two women began to notice that Annabelle seemed to move about the room of her own accord.</p>

                        <h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The Copperbelt University Receives Wildlife Animals from Kansanshi Mining Plc to Promote Conservation and Education</h2>
         
                        <p> In a groundbreaking initiative for wildlife conservation and education, the Copperbelt University has received a diverse range of wildlife animals from Kansanshi mining Plc to enhance the delivery of training programmes at the university.

The transfer of these animals signifies the commitment of both the university and the mining company to protect and preserve the rich biodiversity of the surrounding environment. <br>

Speaking during the event, Kansanshi Mining Plc Corporate Affairs Manager Kyansenga Chitoshi said the mine had spent over K500,000 in capturing the animals and transporting them safely to the university.</p>


<p> “We are donating 19 animals from four species and these are three Zebras, three waterbucks, five Puku and eight impalas. The animals will help to enhance wildlife management training that is offered under the school of natural resources,” said Ms Chitoshi.

CBU Acting Vice Chancellor John Bwalya thanked Kansanshi mine for the gesture saying the animals have added a new dimension to the university.

‘By bringing these wildlife animals onto campus, we can create an interactive learning experience for our students and the wider community, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for the local ecosystem.’

Prof Bwalya said the university has been looking forward to having animals in the nature park since 2014. </p>


<p> Kitwe District Commissioner Lawrence Mwanza who officiated at the event urged CBU management to take care of the animals as they would also add beauty to the institution and Kitwe.

Mr Mwanza also said that primary and secondary school pupils will also benefit by having educational tours to the CBU nature park</p>

  <h2>J. Robert Oppenheimer</h2>
  <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">J. Robert Oppenheimer <br>  <span style="color: green;">(born Julius Robert Oppenheimer /ˈɒpənhaɪmər/ OP-ən-hy-mər; April 22, 1904 –February 18, 1967)  </span> <br> was an American theoretical physicist. He was director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory 
    during World War II and is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".</p>
</section>
  <div class="blog3">

    <p> Born in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925 and a doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927, where he studied under Max Born. After research at other institutions,
 he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936.<br> He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, 
including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation
 for molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process
  in nuclear fusion, and early work on quantum tunneling.<br>  With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.</p>
  </div>


    <div class="blog3">
<p> In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 he was appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, 
    the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in an 
    armed conflict.
</p>
<p> 
In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the
 influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He lobbied for international 
 control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union.
</p>

    </div>

      <div class="blog3">

 <p> 
He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. 
 government and military factions. During the second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA,
 led to the revocation of his security clearance, following a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and his career as a nuclear physicist. Also stripped of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer nevertheless continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, 
 as a gesture of political rehabilitation, he was given the Enrico Fermi Award. He died four years later, of throat cancer.
