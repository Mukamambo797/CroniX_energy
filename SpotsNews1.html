    <p style="margin: 10px;">  <span style="font-size: 80px;">K </span>elvin Kiptum of Kenya celebrates after winning the 2023 Chicago Marathon professional men's division and setting a world record marathon time of 2:00.35 at Grant Park on October 08, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois<br> </p>
     <p> 
NAIROBI, Kenya ‚Äî Marathon world record-holder Kelvin Kiptum, who was set to be a superstar of long-distance running and was a top contender for gold at the Olympics in Paris this year, was killed along with his coach in a car crash in Kenya.
</p>

<p>Their vehicle was the only one involved in the crash late Sunday and Kiptum was driving when it veered off a road and into a ditch before hitting a tree, police said. </p>

<p> 
Kenya's Kiptum was 24 and one of the most exciting prospects to emerge in road running in years, having broken the world record in only his third appearance in an elite marathon. His record, set at last year's Chicago Marathon, was ratified by international track federation World Athletics just last week. </p>
<p> His death reverberated through Kenya, where runners are the biggest sports stars. Kenyans have also gotten used to tragic tales involving their top athletes after a number have died in road crashes, other accidents and domestic violence cases. </p>
<div class="acc_img1">
    <img src="Cronix Sports/SPORTS_IMG/" alt="" style="border: 20px;">

</div>
<p> 
"He was only 24," Kenyan President William Ruto said in a statement offering his condolences. ‚ÄúKiptum was our future.‚Äù

Kiptum and his Rwandan coach, Gervais Hakizimana, were killed in the crash at around 11 p.m., police said. It happened near the town of Kaptagat in western Kenya, in the heart of the high-altitude region that's renowned as a training base for the best distance runners from Kenya and across the world.
</p>
<p> 
Kiptum was born and raised in the area.

A third person, a 24-year-old woman, was also in the car and was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, police said. Kiptum and Hakizimana died at the scene.


</p>
<p>
    Athletes and family members, including Kiptum's father, gathered at the hospital mortuary where the bodies of Kiptum and his coach were taken. One of the athletes, former women's steeplechase world champion Milcah Chemos, struggled to speak while breaking down in tears.

‚ÄúI have no words to explain the loss of Kelvin,‚Äù she said.
</p>
<p> 
Kenneth Kimaiyo, a friend of Kiptum, said he arrived at the crash scene soon after it happened and Kiptum had been thrown out of the car. Photos showed the silver car with a badly mangled roof and the windshield crushed flat.

Kiptum was the first man to run the marathon in under 2 hours, 1 minute in an official race when he set the world record of 2:00.35 in Chicago in October, beating the mark of fellow Kenyan and marathon great Eliud Kipchoge, who is the reigning two-time Olympic champion.
</p>
<p> 
    Kiptum and Kipchoge were expected to provide an enticing all-Kenyan battle for marathon gold in Paris and Kiptum was due to start his season at the Rotterdam Marathon in April, which would have been his first event since breaking the world record.

‚ÄúAn athlete who had a whole life ahead of him to achieve incredible greatness,‚Äù Kipchoge said in a message paying tribute.
</p>

<p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe was one of the first to offer his condolences in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.

‚ÄúWe are shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the devastating loss of Kelvin Kiptum and his coach, Gervais Hakizimana,‚Äù Coe wrote. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt was only earlier this week in Chicago, the place where Kelvin set his extraordinary marathon World Record, that I was able to officially ratify his historic time. An incredible athlete leaving an incredible legacy, we will miss him dearly."

David Rudisha, Kenya's two-time Olympic champion in the 800 meters, wrote on X that Kiptum's death was "a huge loss.‚Äù</p>
<p>Kiptum had immediate success by running the fastest time ever by a marathon debutant at the 2022 Valencia Marathon. The following year, he won the London and Chicago races, two of the most prestigious marathons in the world. He set a new course record at the London Marathon last April and then became the fastest marathoner in the world months later.

While young and new to the circuit, he had already run three of the seven fastest marathon times ever recorded and was seen as a rare talent.

But he was also the latest Kenyan star to die in devastating circumstances. </p>
<p>David Lelei, an All-Africa Games silver medalist, died in a car crash in 2010. Marathon runner Francis Kiplagat was among five people who were killed in a crash in 2018. Nicholas Bett, who won gold in the 400 meter hurdles at the 2015 world championships, also died in a car crash in 2018.

Rudisha, former 10,000 meters world champion Moses Tanui and Olympic silver medalist Paul Tergat have all survived serious road accidents in the East African country. </p>
<p> Samuel Wanjiru, the 2008 Olympic marathon champion who was also tipped to be an all-time great, died in 2011 at the age of 24 after falling from a balcony at his home in Kenya.

Kenyans were perhaps most shocked when Agnes Tirop, a multiple cross-country world champion, was stabbed to death in her home in 2021, allegedly by her husband. He was charged with murder.</p>

<div class="sports_words">
    <p> What was the first sport played on the moon? That would be golf. In 1971, Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard swung a makeshift 6-iron on the moon's surface ‚Äî and missed the ball. His second swing, however, connected, and the golf ball went flying "miles and miles and miles," as Shepard put it after his swing. In reality, the ball traveled only a few hundred yards ‚Äî not bad for a 6-iron. That's not Shepard's fault; while the moon's gravity is only one-sixth Earth's, his space suit was so stiff that he could swing the club with only one hand.</p>

<p>The most dramatic edition of the Africa Cup of Nations came to a fitting end. The hosts Ivory Coast, who once looked down and out at the end of their group games after suffering a historic home defeat, went on to complete the mother of all turnarounds by bouncing back after conceding first in the final. They have become the first hosts to lift the trophy since 2006, capping off one of the most unforgettable tournament campaigns with some incredible scenes. </p>
<p>  <b>üáøüá¶ South Africa 0-0 DR Congo üá®üá© (6-5 on pens) </b><br>
Truthfully, it was a rather forgettable match too. South Africa and DR Congo played out a goalless 90 minutes with little to get fans off their seats. Bafana Bafana controlled proceedings better but struggled to create anything, so DR Congo looked likelier to grab a winner late on after their substitutes provided some attacking spark, but they failed to hit the back of the net.

</p>
<div class="acc_img1">

</div>
<p>Sensibly, we did not have to endure another half an hour of extra time as the match went straight to penalties. South Africa‚Äôs opening miss ceded the advantage, but Ronwen Williams stole the show again by saving a potential winner for the Leopards before stopping another to win the game for his side.

<b>üá≥üá¨ Nigeria 1-2 Ivory Coast üá®üáÆ </b>
Nigeria and the Ivory Coast renewed their rivalry in the final, having previously met in a pivotal group stage fixture just a couple of weeks ago. That was the match in which Nigeria switched to the back-five system, which went on to make them the team with the best defensive record in the knockouts. </p>
<p> The Elephants, for their part, went on an unbelievable ride thereafter. After suffering a historically bad home defeat in their final group, their fate hung in the balance as they needed a series of favourable results to qualify as one of the best third-placed teams. They just about got a knockout berth, but coach Jean-Louis Gasset was sent home anyway and Emerse Fa√© took over.

And then began the Ivorian resurrection. They first overcame defending champions Senegal on penalties in the Round of 16, then turned around a deficit with ten men against Mali thanks to two stoppage-time goals, and finally beat DR Congo by a solitary goal to reach the final. After all those twists and turns, a straightforward final never seemed likely.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="acc_img1">

</div>
<p>Buoyed by a packed Olympic Stadium, the home team were firmly in control throughout the opening exchanges. They saw much more of the ball and created a couple of half-decent chances too, but it was Nigeria who drew first blood as William Troost-Ekong thumped a header home after a corner to score with his team‚Äôs only shot on target of the first half. </p>
<p>As Nigeria started sinking even deeper thereafter, the game looked to be following a similar trajectory to the group fixture, in which Troost-Ekong gave the Super Eagles the lead and then led the defensive effort as their low block frustrated the Ivory Coast. This time, though, the Elephants fought back. </p>
<p> Franck Kessi√© headed a free-kick in just after the hour mark, further bolstering the hosts‚Äô momentum as the crowd grew even louder. The real difference-maker, though, was Simon Adingra. His return from injury added a new dimension to the Ivorian attack in the knockouts, as his dribbling threat enabled him to create chances out of nothing from either flank. He ran rings around Ola Aina throughout the match, but never more decisively than in the 81st minute when he sent in a cross for S√©bastien Haller, who somehow poked the ball home to complete yet another turnaround for the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p> And while we‚Äôre on the subject of comebacks, what better a comeback story than Haller‚Äôs? This time last year, he was slowly returning to top-flight action after battling testicular cancer. His participation in this tournament was in jeopardy too as he missed out on the group stage action due to an ankle injury, almost getting eliminated without taking to the field. The Borussia Dortmund striker‚Äôs presence as a target man then proved decisive when it mattered most, as he scored the winner in both the semi-final and final. </p>
<p>The Ivory Coast saw out the win with relative comfort in the end, crowning one of the most incredible tournament journeys with a trophy lift in front of 60,000 joyous fans. </p>
