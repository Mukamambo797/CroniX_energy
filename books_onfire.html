      ZARA-CHABBY’S DISCOURSES AND THE  COMPLETE TEXT   </h1>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">       Like Zara Chabby would put it, this book is devoted to everyone and no one .
                <br> It's because I think that art is subjective and that my writing is meant to be understood rather than read.
             </p>


      

			      



      <h2>     ZARA CHABBY’S DOWNGOING     </h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">    The joy of people around Zara Chabby exceeded his own when he was approved by the Senate as a member of his country's elite.
         Despite this, he was excited to travel to the Great Campus since he understood that nothing that needed to be learned can be taught.
         However Zara Chabby set it upon himself to go,he long ago hear of this place.
        It created some but simontenusly distroyed others.        
      </p>



      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> 

      When he got there, he saw that the atmosphere and those around him had changed. When he turned to look, 
      he noticed a man-sized left arm on one side and an ear the size of a man on the other.
      <br>  Zara Chabby escaped into the bush out of fear,he run about amimlessly.<br>
      For what he had imagined to be a land of flowing milk and honey was nothing short of a hell.
      <br> He then came upon a valley where he found a cave and made himself at home.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> 
         Zara Chabby's wisdom grew and expanded with time, becoming overpowering like a bee with too much honey. <br> 
         Because of his love for the student monk, he made the decision to leave his cave after 
         4 long years of coontemplation  and returned back to the Great Campus.<br> The Great campus was
          beautiful and it had a skin,however this skin had a disease which was the monk.

        Zara Chabby walked out of his cave as a new being,he had changed but so did the world around him.
        He then began to address the sun with a poetic voice:

  <b>  <br>O great, celestial orb, your luminous presence has graced our skies,<br> 
<br> unwavering and eternal. In this cosmic dance, we share a common essence, <br> 
<br> for we both radiate from within. As I ponder this celestial communion, <br> 
<br> I'm compelled to embark on a quest, a journey to where my heart truly belongs.<br> 

<br> Guide me, magnificent sun, with your radiant wisdom, illuminate my path so that I may discern the profound truths that lie ahead.<br> 
<br>  Yet, dear star, I beseech you to kindle the light within me,<br> 
<br>  not merely to light my way, but to ignite a brilliant blaze that transcends my very being.<br> 
<br> You, a source of enduring brilliance, have cast your light upon the world countless times.<br> 

<br>  Unlike you, I falter in my confidence, seeking companions and followers to share in my journey. <br> 
<br> Is it, perhaps, the human aspect of me that yearns for connection and unity,<br> 
<br>  much like the stars that adorn our night sky?<br> 
<br> In the cosmic symphony, I find myself intertwined with the universe,<br> 
<br>  a mere fragment of the grand design. As I gaze into the infinite expanse,<br>  
<br> I sense the profound connection between my soul and the cosmos,<br>  
<br> a tapestry of existence woven with threads of stardust.<br> 

<br> The sun, the giver of life and light, becomes my guide and confidant on this metaphysical pilgrimage.<br>  I seek not just illumination but enlightenment,<br> 
<br> to understand the intricate interplay of existence and purpose.<br> 



<br>Through the vast expanse of time and space, <br> 
<br> I journey onward, propelled by a yearning to align my essence with the cosmos. <br> 
<br> In the luminous embrace of the sun,<br> 
<br>  I find solace and inspiration to shine, <br> 
<br> not in isolation, but as a beacon of unity, <br> 
<br> illuminating the collective consciousness of humanity.<br>

<br> As I continue my celestial odyssey,<br> 
<br>  I am reminded that we are all interconnected,<br>  
  <br>  like constellations in the boundless night sky, <br> 
<br> and that within each of us lies a radiant star waiting to be discovered.

    <div class="chap1"> 
<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> 
 Thus begun the downward spiral of Zara Chabby started at that point.
</p>
</div>
 </section>


<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> 
    He didn't have to go long before he saw a renowned monk, who turned to face Zara Chabby and remarked,
<br> “But alas, I recognize those eyes. They are Zara Chabby's.”<br>
Zara Chabby was unable to suppress a smile. 

<br>“Where are you going, dear fellow?"<br> asked Zara Chabby they came into contact in the bush, addressed the monk Ching Chong.
<br>“ Are you searching for happiness here in the wilderness?” <br>
<br>"No, no," <br> Ching Chong retorted. <br>"I'm attempting to flee from the Monk. 
I'm no longer attracted to his ways. More so than with him, I feel safer with wild animals.”<br>

<br>“But my love for the Monk overflows, and I want to hug him with open arms”,<br>
 Zara Chabby murmured with a reproachful expression. 
<br>“I owe him a lot since he is a bigger part of me than I am.” Zara Chabby went on.<br>

<br>"Well, best of luck with that, Zara Chabby,"<br> Ching Chong joked. 
<br>“But let me tell you, the Monk is like an animal and must be treated as such.”<br>
<br>“Take it from someone who has lived among him for a long time. 
You ought to act like a fool and blend in when you're around him, because he does not take differences lightly.
But I can still see in your eyes that you are determined to go to him, am I right?"<br>
</p>

  
    <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> 
        Zara Chabby paused, reflecting on Ching Chong's words.
        <br> "My love for the Monk is bittersweet. The more I seek him, the more he avoids me. 
        Yet, he is more a part of me than I am myself, and I am drawn to him naturally. It is only right that I am pulled towards him." <br>
		</p>
		
       <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">
       The two then laughed heartily, like school boys, before parting ways. 
       As Zara Chabby continued his journey towards the ill Monk, he pondered Ching Chong's advice. 
       Perhaps Ching Chong was right, he thought to himself. Some things cannot be taught and must be learned through experience.
        Education may be nothing more than the highest form of foolery.
        Zara Chabby shook his head, trying to dismiss the thought, and continued towards the great Campus which was beautiful and had a skin,but on this skin there was a dieases for example the Monk.
       </p>
	   <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">
       As Zara Chabby stood before a magnificent white building on campus, he was drawn to its firm structure and commanding presence. Seeing a cluster of people gathered, 
       he saw an opportunity to share his wisdom, and he began to speak:
       </p>
       <p style="color: azure;"> 
     <b> <br> "My fellow monks, I come to you from not too far away, closer to your hearts than you might think. I bring a message that will be sweet to your ears and nourishment to your soul.
       "I am Zara Chabby, and while some among you may have heard of me, let us not make assumptions. This is not a business negotiation; I am truly here before you.”<br>
       </p> <b>
       

      
       <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> As he spoke at this point, his voice had changed and sounded as though he was at a great 
       distance.He then went on:</p>
  




      <b> <p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> “My philosophy is easy to grasp and is just right by your side. Lend me your ears and hear what you have longed for but never knew until now.

I can speak plainly so that my words penetrate your heart. However, your hearts seem as hard as rock and as dark as my deepest abyss," 
</p></b>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">
Despite his attempts to connect with them, they laughed and mocked him, but he sensed there was evil behind their laughter.

 However Zara Chabby went on with his speech exclaiming about  the supermonk. While they couldn't be the supermonk themselves,
 they could seek to build and go beyond themselves as forerunners.
 Zara Chabby spoke with great compassion and love for the monks, but their laughter continued to drown his spirit out.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">
<br> “We now know that you can crack a joke,now show us that you can shut up too!!”  one monk spuoted.
<br>“What rubbish does this one preach?!” <br> anohter said.
</p>


  <section class="chap"> 
        <div class="chap1">

<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> Zara Chabby did not choose to pay attention to his ears,he chose not to belive what he had heard.<br>This is not the reception Zara Chabby imagined,he thought or warm cheers and uplifting greetings.He thought of geniune smiles not the facad he faced now.<br>
It had seemed that his thoughts had played his for the fool he was.He then shock his head and laughed.</p>

  </div>
</section>
                <div class="acc_img1">
                    <img src="IMAGES/crowed.webp">

                </div>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> Now disamay grew in the crowed,why would one who is been rebuked laugh?.<br>
Some thought he was crazy,but those who where seen laughing once upon a time,
where thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.
But some within the crowed heard truth in what Zara Chabby had said and paid it thought,
the crowed however grow in size rapidly. <br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">People were draw to this single man,Zara Chabby.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;">
Sets of eyes so straight some croacked watch Zara Chabby’s body propagate away.<br>
Before he disapeared into the forest he paid the monk a stern look,the disapeared into the thicket of the wilderness.
Voiceses mummured within  the crowed.
Not so long after this word of this altercation rung accross the Great Campus and through the Great Land.<br>
Word of Zara Chabby the monk,some fled towards him some fleed away. But his influnce grew and within no time he had disciples who followed him without his consent but Zara Chabby kept them around regardless.
