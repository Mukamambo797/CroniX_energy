                          <h2>Guinness World Records reveal the reason behind deactivating the longest-kiss world record</h2>
                                <p> The Guinness World Records (GWR) recently made an announcement regarding the deactivation of the longest-kiss world record, citing concerns over safety.
                                     In a statement released on their website, GWR explained that certain rules of the competition conflicted with their updated policies. </p> 

                                     <p>As a result, GWR has replaced the longest kiss record category with the longest kissing marathon.
According to GWR, the longest kiss ever lasted was of 58 hours 35 minutes, achieved by Thai couple Ekkachai and Laksana Tiranarat. 
<br> The superlative smooch took place at an event organised by Ripley's Believe It or Not! in Pattaya, Thailand, beginning on 12 February 2013 and ending two days later, on Valentine’s Day.
</p>
          </div>

  <div class="blog3">
             <p> "We did this because the competition had become too dangerous, and some of the rules conflicted with our current, updated policies." the website reads.
Citing the rules of the record, which all challengers were required to follow, GWR also provided an explanation of the challenges faced by participants in adhering to these rules while attempting to break the record.</p>
                         
<p> Due to the escalating length of the record to be broken and the absence of rest breaks, participants were increasingly vulnerable to the risks associated with sleep deprivation, including the development of psychosis.
Previous attempts at breaking the kissing record had already witnessed several instances of contestants experiencing adverse effects and negative consequences.
Announcing the new longest kissing marathon, GWR said,</p>
          </div>

            <div class="blog3">
            <p>   "Although we no longer monitor the longest kiss record, we have replaced it with something else: the longest kissing marathon,"
Challengers in this new contest are granted the allowance of rest breaks to ensure their well-being. </p>

 <p> Every uninterrupted hour of kissing, challengers are entitled to five minutes of rest, which can be accumulated if not utilized.</p>
 <p>  During these rest breaks, challengers have the freedom to sleep, eat, and separate their lips, effectively reducing the risk of fainting, experiencing psychosis, or necessitating resuscitation.
"There is no current record holder for the longest kissing marathon. Could you be the first?", GWR said.</p>

              <h2>THE LIGER</h2>
              <div class="blog3">
                 <p>The liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a tigress, or
                     female tiger (Panthera tigris). The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. 
                     <br> The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines.<br> They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, 
                    ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons </p>
                    <h2 class="liger"> HISTORY</h2>       
                    <p> The history of lion-tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th century in India. In 1798, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger. The name "liger", a portmanteau of lion and tiger, was coined by the 1930s.[4] "Ligress" is used to refer to a female liger, on the model of "tigress".

In 1825, G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824.[3] The parents and their three liger offspring are also depicted with their trainer in a 19th-century painting in the naïve style.

Two liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria. 
                            </p>
                            <p> On 14 December 1900 and on 31 May 1901, Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at the Hagenbeck's Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897.

In Animal Life and the World of Nature (1902–1903),<br>  A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck's "lion-tiger" hybrids:</p>

<h2>APPEARANCE </h2>

<p>The liger has a faint tiger-like striped pattern upon a lionesque tawny background. 
</p>
<p> In addition, it may inherit rosettes from the lion parent (lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings). These markings may be black, dark brown or sandy. The background color may be correspondingly tawny, sandy or golden. In common with tigers, as an example of countershading, the underparts are pale. The specific pattern and color depend upon which subspecies
     the parents were and how the genes interact in the offspring. </p>

     <h2>What Are The Top 10 Cheapest Currencies In The World As Of January 2024? </h2>
     <hr> 
     <h3> <b> 1.</b> Iranian Rial (IRR) <br> 1 INR = 505 IRR</h3>
     <p> The Iranian rial tops the list of the cheapest currencies in the world. 
        The fall in the value of the currency can be explained by various factors. </p>
     <p> To begin with, the termination of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 was followed by foreign investors’ withdrawal from the country. The nuclear program and the Iran-Iraq war also played a 
        huge part in causing financial distress along with other political unrest in Iran.</p>
<hr> 


     <h3> <b> 2.</b>   Vietnamese Dong (VND) <br> 1 INR = 292 VND</h3>
     <p>  The country has long followed a centralized economy. Although the country embarked on a path of forming a market economy, it still has a long road to walk. </p>
     <p>The currency is highly devalued currently but the chances are high of the currency improving considering the improvement in the economy. </p>
<hr> 
      <h3> <b> 3.</b>   Sierra Leonean Leone (SLL) 1 INR = 270 SLL</h3>
     <p> Sierra Leonean Leone is an African currency that is highly affected by poverty. Africa has had a history of financial scandals, corruption and conflicts including a heinous civil war in the western African region.  </p>
     <p>All these led to a downfall of the country’s economy and the value of its currency. The Ebola infection added to Sierra Leonean’s woes, and is a constant factor that affects the country’s population that further consumes financial aid. </p>
<hr> 
      <h3> <b> 4.</b>  Lao or Laotian Kip (LAK) <br> 1 INR = 245 LAK </h3>
     <p> The Lao or Laotian Kip is not a devalued currency but a currency that has had a low rate since the time of its introduction in 1952. Over the years the value of the currency has improved. Also, a railway is planned that will connect Beijing to Laos, which might draw investors to this small country.  </p>
     <p> Although it is the cheapest currency, it is a promising one towards improving its value.</p>
<hr> 
      <h3> <b> 5.</b>Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) 1 INR = 187.50 IDR  </h3>
     <p> In the last seven years, the currency has not improved even the slightest. The factors that have brought devaluation of the currency include its decreasing foreign exchange reserves..  

 </p>

     <p>  Given Indonesia is heavily dependent on the export market, the fall of the cost of the commodities has further devalued its currency value</p>
 <hr> 
      <h3> <b> 6.</b> Uzbekistani Som (UZS) <br> 1 INR = 147.14 UZS  </h3>
     <p> The government of Uzbekistan has employed many means to improve the economy of the country. But none of them have proved to be successful. The most recent one is the reformatory measure, so the changes that these measures will bring are yet to be explored in terms of currency value.  </p>
     <p> The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the economy deeply too. While data suggests that Uzbekistan has resumed internal economic operations starting the third quarter of 2022, the decline in its industrial output has increased the unpredictability in the currency’s future.</p>

<hr> 
      <h3> <b> 7.</b> Guinean Franc (GNF) <br> 1 INR = 103 GNF </h3>
     <p> Guinea as a country faces corruption and political instability that leads to a weakened currency. The country’s currency value is getting devalued by the passing years. </p>
    

<hr> 

      <h3> <b> 8.</b>  Paraguayan Guarani (PYG) <br>1 INR = 87 PYG</h3>
     <p>  Paraguay is undergoing a terrible economic downturn as a result of high inflation, a high unemployment rate, increase in poverty and corruption. These factors have left a negative impact on the value of the currency.</p>

<hr> 

      <h3> <b> 9.</b>   Ugandan Shilling (USH) <br>  INR = 45 UGX</h3>
     <p> Uganda faced several setbacks under Idi Amin’s governance. The country’s policies including immigration policies have impacted the country’s economy negatively. The impacts still affect the development of the country. </p>
     <p>However, the last few years witnessed improvement in its value but not more than 5% of the total devaluation.  </p>

<hr> 

      <h3> <b> 10.</b> 10. Iraqi Dinar (IQD) <br>1 INR = 15 IQD </h3>
     <p> Iraq’s currency, the Iraqi dinar, is issued by the country’s central bank and is subdivided into 1,000 fils. Since the year 1990, inflation has made the film devoid of much value. In the past decade, the country also faced political instability. </p>

  <h2>What Was the First Photo Ever Taken?</h2>
<p> It took at least eight hours to produce the first photo ever taken. Known as “View From the Window at Le Gras,” the first known photograph was a result of 
    experiments conducted by French inventor and photographer Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.</p>
<p>Using a process called heliography — which involved exposing a polished pewter plate coated with bitumen of Judea to light — and a camera obscura device, the square photograph depicts a simple scene: the wing of a house, a dovecote, and a barn roof.</p>
<h3> History of the First Photograph Ever Taken</h3>
<p> 
History of the First Photograph Ever Taken
Known as the world’s earliest surviving photograph, “View From the Window at Le Gras” depicts rooftops, a tree and the surrounding landscape. Niépce took the first-ever photograph in 1826 or 1827 from an upstairs window of his estate in Saint-Lop-de-Varenees, Burgundy, France, using a camera obscura and a bitumen-coated pewter plate. He exposed it for several hours. In 1827, Niépce wrote that, while the process needed more work, it marked “the first uncertain step in a completely new direction.”




<p>The earliest photograph was almost lost to time, and Niépce’s contributions to photography were almost overshadowed by French photographer Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre’s work.
</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the efforts of historians and researchers, such as Helmut and Alison Gernsheim, led to the discovery of “View From the Window at Les Gras.” Helmut Gernsheim’s "The History of Photography" played a crucial role in bringing attention to the photograph’s significance.
</p>  
<p> After being a part of private collections in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin purchased the heliograph.</p>
