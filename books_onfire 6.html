<h2> HOMECOMING   <br>PART 1     </h2>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " > 
 No sooner had  Zara-Chabby left the momas had he heard the cry of distress  even
  thrice harder than before for it was so loud he thought to himself that he could see
   it's source .Zara-Chabby sprung up with viloent gestures and gave out a loud cry like
    a beast .He then began to propagate in what he knew to be it's source 
"All these wanderings finally have came to an end for this I now know" he thought 
"Is the source of the cry" he speculeted with all his assurity
</p>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " >
"But how about if the Supermonk is nothing like what I thought" Zara-Chabby combabulated  again, "How about if it is all folly,will I be ashemed?" thrice Zara-Chabby thought..
Zara-Chabby began to inflict himself with sharp words and even sharper thoughts
He then began to speak thus to his wounded heart:"I find Language pleasing because she is as funny as I am but I like her better when she is silent.Because the things that can be shown carry more weight than those that can be  said"
 
 </p>

 <p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; "  > Thus I teach</p>

 <p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " > 

"The strongest ties are those that can not be seen,even the dead know Zara-Chabby everything that can be seen is only but transitory subject to interpretation good,bad,evil,right, wrong all just but words meant to fill up context"
Zara-Chabby diluted himself with such thoughts and in no time he had reached the source of the Cry but to his greatest amazement the cry led him right back to his cave Zara-Chabby stood before his cave for several moments he gazed blikly into the abysses about him and the abysses gazed back at him
"Have my eyes decieved me?,have my delusions finally diluted me like a river that flows back to itself I am right back where I started from how embarancing,all that I seeked was right here inside me i could not see,I was blind"*


</p>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " > Zara Chabby's heart was moved to a great kindness.</p>
<h2 style="color: black; font-size: 25px; " > PART 2</h2>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " > 

Zara-Chabby had finaly summoned  the corage to go into his cave 
There he found his friends;his Muse,two momma's,and his solitude
He could not help but smile his guests saw him in a different light as though he was 
emmiting the light 
not reflecting it so he seem out of this world<br>
"Astronomical!"shouted the momma to the left,of the duo
"Zara-Chabby yours eyes shine" she went on Zara-Chabby could not help but smile he stood
 and look at his guests with a loving eye and began to say thus:
 </p>

 <p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " >
"Your company is stimulating ,I am glad i hold such a small happeniess to be a big
 happiness because because my heart is bound the good ,the bad I love with my heart but
  what is good and bad? ,all just words,your presence here,however I can reach out to"
Zara-Chabby then paused and began to speak,but his voice sounded as though it was coming 
from a far distance.
</p>

 <p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " > 
"What more could a warrior from war want as a gift a kingly catch"
Zara-Chabby's heart was moved to joy ,his Muse who could not hold her silence any
 longer began to say thus:

</p>




     <section class="chap"> 
        <div class="chap1">
<p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " >
"But the effect is also the same for us we adore you,in you in all your light 
you are a spectacle and the heaven look upon you lovingly" 

 
</p>
</div>
</section>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; " > 
  Zara-Chabby could not help but smile even thrice,but His guests had to leave him because it was now 
  sunset and only the downward dwell in the darkness and thrive for it.Through his cave and into the forest 
  did he lead  his guests back to safety they will always be in Zara-Chabby's heart .For after they had left him,he 
  long for their presence again he then returned to his
  solitude because Solitude is hard on us so that we  be soft on others
