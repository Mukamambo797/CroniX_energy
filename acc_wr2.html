Barcelona forward takes women’s prize for record sixth time
Napoli’s Victor Osimhen beats Mohamed Salah to men’s award

</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen has been named the African men’s footballer of the year while his compatriot Asisat Oshoala, the Barcelona forward, claimed the top prize in the women’s category.

Osimhen scored 26 goals, topping the Serie A scoring charts as he helped Napoli end a 33-year wait for the Italian title last season. The Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah and Paris Saint-Germain’s Moroccan wing-back Achraf Hakimi were the other two final nominees.  
									  
                                </p>
                                 

                                 <p>

                                   “It is a dream come true,” the 24-year-old Osimhen said at the ceremony in Marrakech, Morocco. “I have to thank everybody who has helped me on this journey, and all Africans who have helped to put me on the map despite my faults.”

The Napoli striker is the first Nigerian player to win the award since Nwankwo Kanu in 1999. Senegal’s Sadio Mané had won the previous two awards, in 2019 and 2022. Samuel Eto’o (Cameroon) and Yaya Touré (Ivory Coast) have each won the award four times.

                                 </p>
                           
                           
                            <p>
                                       Oshoala was named the African women’s footballer of the year for a record sixth time. She overcame injury to help Nigeria reach the last 16 at the 2023 World Cup, where they were beaten by England on penalties. Oshoala scored in the 3-2 group stage win over Australia, finding the net for a third consecutive World Cup.

The 29-year-old also won the Women’s Champions League and Spanish title with Barcelona. Oshoala beat South Africa’s Thembi Kgatlana and Zambia’s Barbra Banda to claim the award, which she also won in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022.Morocco won men’s team of the year after their thrilling run to the World Cup semi-finals in Qatar last year, while their manager, Walid Regragui, won the men’s coach of the year award.

                           Nigeria took the trophy for women’s team of the year, while South Africa’s Desiree Ellis won the women’s coach award for the fourth time in succession.

The awards are voted for by a panel made up of the Confederation of African Football (Caf) technical committee, African journalists and broadcasters, and head coaches and captains of national teams and leading African clubs.

             <h2>For all the hype in 2023, we still don’t know what AI’s long-term impact will be</h2>
			<p>
			Innovation,” wrote the economist William Janeway in his seminal book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy, 
			“begins with discovery and culminates in speculation.” That just about sums up 2023. The discovery was AI (as represented by ChatGPT), and the speculative bubble is what we have now, in which huge public corporations launch products that are known to “hallucinate” (yes, that’s now a technical term relating to large language models), and spend money like it’s going out of fashion on the kit needed to make even bigger ones. As I write, I see a report that next year Microsoft plans to buy 150,000 Nvidia chips – at $30,000 (£24,000) a pop.
			It’s a kind of madness. But when looked at it through the Janeway lens, ’twas ever thus.
			</p>
			 
			 <p>  
			 “The innovations that have repeatedly transformed the architecture of the market economy,” he writes, “from canals to the 
			 internet, have required massive investments to construct networks whose value in use could not be imagined at the outset of deployment.” 
			 Or, to put it more crudely, what we retrospectively regard as examples of technological progress have mostly come about through outbreaks of
			 irrational exuberance that involved colossal waste, bankrupted investors and caused social turmoil. Bubbles, in other words. In recent times,
			 think of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. Or in earlier times, of the US railway boom of the 1850s onwards in which no fewer than five
			 different railway lines were built between New York and Chicago. In both bubbles, an awful lot of people lost their shirts. But, as the
			 economist Brad DeLong memorably pointed out in his 2003 Wired article Profits of Doom, “Americans and the American economy benefited enormously from the resulting network of railroad tracks that stretched from sea to shining sea. For a curious thing happened as railroad bankruptcies and price wars put steady downward pressure on shipping prices and slashed rail freight and passenger rates across the country: new industries sprang up.”
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 <p> 
			 So the lesson of history in relation to tech bubbles is this: what things will be left after the bubble bursts? Because they always do.
			 Which neatly brings us back to the current madness about AI. Sure, it’s wonderful that it enables people who are unable to string sentences 
			 together to “write” coherent prose. And, as Cory Doctorow observes, it’s great that teenagers playing Dungeons & Dragons can access an image
			 generator that creates epic illustrations of their characters fighting monsters – even if the images depict “six-fingered swordspeople with 
			 three pupils in each eye”. And that the tech can do all of the other tricks that are entrancing millions of people – who are, by the way, 
			 mostly using it for free. But what of lasting value will be left? What will the historians of the next century regard as the enduring legacy 
			 of the technology?
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 
			 <p> 
			 At the moment, it’s obviously impossible to say, not least because we always overestimate the short-term impacts of novel
			 technologies while grossly underestimating their long-term effects. Imagine someone trying to assess the civilisational impact
			 of printing in 1485, 40 years after Gutenberg printed his first Bible. Nobody knew then that it would undermine the authority of
			 the Catholic church, fuel the thirty years’ war, enable the rise of what became modern science and the creation of new industries and 
			 professions, and even, as the cultural critic Neil Postman observed, change our conceptions of childhood. Put bluntly, print shaped human 
			 society for 400 years. If this machine-learning technology is as transformative as some people are claiming, its long-term impact may be just as profound as print has been.
			 </p>
			 
			 
			 
			 <p> 
			 So where might we look for clues as to how that might play out? Three areas are worth thinking about. The first is that the technology, flawed as it is at present, looks like providing a significant augmentation of human capability – a new kind of “power steering for the mind”. But of course that also means the augmentation of warped minds. Second, there’s the question of how sustainable it will be, given its insatiable demand for energy and natural as well as human resources. (Remember that much of the output of current AI is kept relatively sanitised by the unacknowledged labour of poorly paid people in poor countries.) Third, how quickly – if ever – will it make economic sense? At the moment there’s an assumption that public, government and tech-industry exuberance will automatically translate into widespread deployment of, and real returns on, the stupendous costs of running the machines. If you believe observers such as the boss of Accenture, the global consultancy company, that might turn out to be wishful thinking. “Most companies,” she said this month, “are not ready to deploy generative artificial intelligence at scale because they lack strong data infrastructure or the controls needed
			 to make sure the technology is used safely.” Yep. So here’s hoping for a more realistic new year!

              <h2>Mali: UN peacekeeping mission ends after decade</h2>
			  
        <p> 
		Minusma - the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission - began in 2013 after an armed rebellion, but has been asked to leave by the country's ruling military government.

The UN mission's head said it did a lot but fell below expectations.

With some 310 peacekeepers killed, Minusma was the UN's second deadliest mission worldwide, after Lebanon.

In the summer, Mali told the UN that its 12,000 peacemakers needed to leave, and the UN Security Council voted to withdraw the mission

UN staff have been leaving in stages for months, with a deadline of 31 December for full withdrawal.
		</p> 
		
		    <p> 
		      Timbuktu was one of three sites which were supposed to remain open to manage the end of the mission after 31 December, but the UN was worried about the presence of militants, reports said.

El-Ghassim Wane, head of the UN mission, said in a recorded statement that there was a "gap between what we were mandated to do and we were able to do".

"We did a lot but definitely it was below expectations and below the needs," he added.
		   </p>
		   
		    <p> 
		      Security in Mali is fragile, with armed Islamist and independence movements active.

Mali's government is also building closer ties to Russia - including by relying on the Wagner mercenary group - just as Western influence declines.

The mission began 10 years ago, after separatist rebels and Islamist fighters banded together and occupied northern Mali in an effort to create a separate state.

		   <p> 
			France sent troops to try and put down the uprising, followed by UN peacekeepers.

The threat from Islamist militants, who have killed several thousand people and forced tens of thousands from their homes, continued over the years.

And despite the presence of UN peacekeepers and French troops, who led counter-terror operations, the number of terror attacks in Mali steadily increased, as did the number of Malians joining insurgent groups. France announced it was withdrawing troops last year.
		
		  </p>
          <p> 
		  Mali has been run by military leaders following two coups in 2020 and 2021.

The country has been struggling with a widespread jihadist insurgency that has made much of the north and east ungovernable.


In recent years, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara had made major gains, occupying large swathes of territory in southeast Mali.
        </p>

		  <p> 
		  Many central regions have also recently been experiencing a surge in violence perpetrated by militants linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State groups.

Fighting also broke out again in August between the separatists and government troops after eight years of calm, as both sides scrambled to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the UN peacekeepers.

          <h2>Record-breaking felines: The world's oldest living cat and the oldest cat to ever live</h2>

           <p> The oldest living cat is currently Flossie, a 27-year-old British tortoiseshell cat. Flossie is roughly 120 human years old and has lived in four homes. Her owner, Vicki Green, told Guinness World Records she is affectionate and playful and in good health,
             despite being deaf and poor-sighted and occasionally needing help grooming or using the litter box. </p>
             <p> Flossie was adopted in 1995 by an employee at Merseyside Hospital in Liverpool, where, as a young stray, she lived in a colony of cats close to the hospital. 

Flossie will turn 28 in December 2023.</p>
<h3> What is the oldest cat to ever live? </h3>
<p> The oldest cat to ever live was Creme Puff, a Texas cat who lived to be 38 years old and 3 days. Creme Puff was born in August 1967 and died in August 2005, according to Guinness World Records. </p>
