                                Our innate human nature leans towards expecting gratitude, yet the reality is we often 
                                receive it rarely, if at all. This can lead to disappointment and resentment, but what if we
                                 shifted our perspective?

                                    how many of these men  do think stooped to thank Liebowitz?or even thought of sending him a gift card?How many?Guess?....Thats right -none.

                               <p> 
                                  Just like any muscle, gratitude requires exercise to grow. The bodybuilders understand this principle well. 
                                  When encountering ingratitude, remember this analogy. It's not a reflection of your actions,
                                  but rather a reflection of the individual's lack of cultivated appreciation.

                                    Grumbling about ingratitude only fuels our own negativity. Instead, let's ponder on alternative perspectives. 
                                    Perhaps the act was expected and not considered a favor, or perhaps our relationship with the individual lacks genuine connection. Ultimately, 
                                    the focus should be on the act itself, not the anticipated reaction.

                          <p>
                          Discovered in a Neolithic tomb in Italy, the Lovers of Valdaro are a pair of skeletons that have been holding each 
                          other 
                          for 6,000 years.
                        </p>
                   
                    <p> <span class="keyword" > I</span>n 2007, a team of archaeologists discovered a tomb near Mantua in the region of Lombardy, 
                        Italy. Inside, they found a pair of skeletons lying face to face, 
                        their bodies intertwined as if holding each other in a “lovers’ embrace.”
                        </p>
                   
                   
                   
                        <p> 
                         
                            Photos of the skeleton couple quickly circulated throughout the media — and the fact that the Lovers of Valdaro, as they came to be known, were discovered just before Valentine’s Day made the story especially resonant.

For many, the positioning of the bodies called to mind the story of Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers who met an untimely and tragic end. As archaeologists examined the Valdaro Lovers, they made a number of curious discoveries.

Firstly, the couple died around 6,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. Neolithic double burials were a rarity as is, but the couple’s positioning made the discovery all the more unique. Secondly, the young man and woman were each around 20 years of age when they died. There were no indications that their deaths were violent, and their bodies were likely put into position posthumously.

                        And although it’s impossible to know the true story of who the lovers once were, the image of their bodies locked in eternal embrace and the unique circumstances surrounding the burial has made the Lovers of Valdaro a source of intrigue and speculation for over a decade.

                      <h3> The Discovery Of The Valdaro Lovers</h3>  
                        <p>   
In early February 2007, a team of archaeologists led by Elena Menotti announced that their excavation in the village of 
Valdaro — near Mantua, Italy — had yielded a remarkable discovery: the skeletons of a man and woman lying face to face, 
arms and legs entwined.

This unique discovery quickly spread through the media and online as photographs of the skeleton couple were released.

Speaking to The Daily Mail at the time, Menotti expressed her excitement regarding the find, saying,
“I have been involved in lots of digs all over Italy, but nothing has excited me as much as this. 
I’ve been doing this job for 25 years. I’ve done digs at Pompeii, all the famous sites.

           <h3> The Theories Behind The Lovers Of Valdaro  </h3>          
      <p>                 
          
For many, photographs of the Lovers of Valdaro told a tragic tale reminiscent of Shakespeare’s most famous work — and in fact, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is even sent to Mantua after slaying Tybalt Capulet in a duel. When he returns to Verona, he learns of Juliet’s “death,” setting in motion the events that leads to both lovers’ demise.

One early theory surrounding the Valdaro Lovers suggested that the man, the body on the left, had been killed, and that the woman had then been sacrificed so she might accompany his soul in the afterlife.
                       </p>
<p> 
    Initial observations supported this theory. The male skeleton was found with a flint arrowhead in his neck, while the female skeleton had a long stone blade along her thigh and two flint knives beneath her pelvis. However, an osteological examination revealed nothing to suggest their deaths had been violent.

“We have found plenty of women embracing children but never a couple, much less a couple hugging — and they really are hugging,” Menotti said. “From an initial examination they appear young as their teeth are not worn down, but we have sent the remains to a laboratory to establish their age at the time of death.”

                              <p> <i>Archaeologists believe the Valdaro Lovers were arranged
                                in this position after death. </i></p>
                        </section>



<h3>Finding A New Home For The Lovers Of Valdaro </h3>
<p> 
    
A week after the discovery was made, another question arose: What would happen to the Valdaro Lovers? Often when ancient bodies are recovered during archaeological digs, their bones are transported to a laboratory for analysis, and each bone is individually studied to paint a general picture of that ancient person’s life and death.

The Lovers of Valdaro, however, were a unique case. For 6,000 years they had embraced each other. Would they be split up for the sake of science?

Thankfully, Menotti reached a quick conclusion, telling Reuters, “We want to keep them just as they have been all this time — together.” Rather than removing the bones one by one and reassembling them later, archaeologists opted to square out and remove the entire plot of earth where the couple was buried and transport it all together.

    Archaeological Museum of Mantua, where they remain to this day.</i>

             <h2>In 1704, Isaac Newton Predicts the World Will End in 2060</h2>

            <p>
                We have become quite used to pronouncements of doom, from scientists predicting the sixth mass extinction due to 
                the measurable effects of climate change, and from religionists declaring the apocalypse due to a surfeit of sin. 
                It’s almost impossible to imagine these two groups of people agreeing on anything other than the ominous portent of 
                their respective messages. But in the early days of the scientific revolution—the days of Shakespeare contemporary 
                Francis Bacon, and later 17th century Descartes—it was not at all unusual to find both kinds of reasoning, or 
                unreasoning,
                 in the same person, along with beliefs in magic, divination, astrology, etc.
            </p>
                          <p> 
                           Yet even in this maelstrom of heterodox thought and practices,
                            Sir Isaac Newton stood out as a particularly odd co-existence of esoteric biblical prophecy, occult beliefs, and 
                            a rigid, formal mathematics that not only adhered to the inductive scientific method, but also expanded its 
                            potential by applying general axioms to specific cases. Yet many of Newton’s general principles would seem 
                            totally inimical to the naturalism of most physicists today. As he was formulating the principles of gravity and three
                             laws of motion, for example, Newton also sought the legendary Philosopher’s Stone and attempted to turn metal to gold.
                              Moreover, the devoutly religious Newton wrote theological treatises interpreting Biblical prophecies and predicting
                               the end of the world. 
                           The date he arrived at? 2060.
                          </p>

                           <p> 

                                   Newton seems, writes science blog Another Pale Blue Dot,<br> <i> “as confident of his predictions
                                    in this realm as he was in the rational world of science."</i>
                            </p>


                            <p> 
                                    In a 1704 letter exhibited at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, above, Newton describes his “recconing”:

<p>  
<i>  " So then the time times & half a time are 42 months or 1260 days or three years & an half, recconing twelve months to a yeare & 30 days to a month as was done in the Calendar of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of lived [sic] kingdoms, the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end A.C. 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner."

</i>
</p>


<p> 
Newton further demonstrates his confidence in the next sentence, writing that his intent, “though not to assert” an answer, should in any event “put a stop the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently predicting the time of the end.” Indeed. So how did he arrive at this number? Newton applied a rigorous method, that is to be sure.

If you have the patience for exhaustive description of how he worked out his prediction using the Book of Daniel, you may read one here by historian of science Stephen Snobelen, who also points out how widespread the interest in Newton’s odd beliefs has become, reaching across every continent, though scholars have known about this side of the Enlightenment giant for a long time.

              <i>In this Tiny Expedition, we start with an age-old question. 
               Are zebras white with black stripes or black with white stripes?
              </i> 
           </p>
            
           <p> 
              Greg Barsh, MD, PhD, is the resident expert on animal morphology at the HudsonAlpha
               Institute for Biotechnology, and he has a definitive answer.
           </p>


<p> <b> “Zebras are black with white stripes.” </b></p>

<p>  <i> How is he so sure?</i><br>

Barsh explains, <i> “The reason we know that is…some of the early work we did on zebras was a collaboration with an owner of a zebra. We visited her once, and we asked her that exact same question.”</i> 
</p>

 <p> <i>The collaborator shaved a little hair away and revealed that zebras have completely black skin. </i>   </p>

   
          
            
            
<p> 
    Zebras aren’t alone in their stripiness though. Most equids—relatives of the horse—have some kind of striping.
     The primary exception is the modern domesticated horse. Only dun horses, a small minority of domesticated horses,
      still feature some striping.   <br>

However, equids all come from a common ancestor, 
meaning at some point domesticated horses had stripes…and lost them.

          <h2>Lamborghini's Origin story</h2>
    <p>
    Lamborghini is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer known for producing high-performance vehicles. The company was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian industrialist and entrepreneur, in 1963.

Ferruccio Lamborghini initially started his career as a tractor manufacturer. He established a successful business called Lamborghini Trattori, which produced agricultural machinery. As a wealthy and successful businessman, Lamborghini had a passion for luxury cars and owned several prestigious models,
 including Ferrari cars.
    </p>



    <p>
     However, Lamborghini became dissatisfied with his Ferrari cars and experienced multiple issues with them. He believed that the vehicles lacked certain features and had mechanical problems. Frustrated with Ferrari's response to his concerns, Lamborghini decided to build his own cars to compete with Ferrari.

In 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company Automobili Lamborghini in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. He assembled a team of talented engineers, including Giotto Bizzarrini and Gianpaolo Dallara, to develop his vision of a perfect sports car.
    </p>
   



       <p>
       The first Lamborghini car, the Lamborghini 350 GT, was unveiled in 1964 at the Geneva Motor Show. It was a grand tourer powered by a V12 engine and featured a luxurious interior. The 350 GT received positive reviews for its performance and design, establishing Lamborghini as a serious competitor in the sports car market.

Lamborghini gained further recognition and success with subsequent models, including the iconic Miura, Countach, Diablo, and Gallardo. These cars showcased cutting-edge design, advanced technology, and exceptional performance, attracting enthusiasts and collectors worldwide.

Over the years, Lamborghini faced various challenges, including financial difficulties and changes in ownership. However, the brand's commitment to producing high-performance and visually striking cars has remained consistent. Lamborghini continues to produce some of the most desirable and exclusive sports cars in the world, catering to automotive enthusiasts who appreciate both luxury and performance.

  <h2><b> Sha’Carri Richardson wins 100, claims fastest woman in world title</b> </h2>


<p>
         Sha’Carri Richardson proclaimed,<i> “I’m not back, I’m better”</i> <br> this season. She put an exclamation point on that statement at the 2023 track and field world championships in Budapest, Hungary.

The charismatic sprinter is officially the fastest woman in the world.

            <i>Richardson ran a 10.65 to win her first ever world title in the women’s 100 meters. Her time set a championship 
    record, breaking the mark held by Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce by .02 seconds.

Jamaica's Shericka Jackson finished second with a time of 10.72 and Fraser-Pryce placed third, crossing the line in 10.77. </i>

    <p>

        Richardson is the first American woman to win a 100-meter world title since the late Tori Bowie won gold at
         the 2017 worlds. She joined fellow American Noah Lyles as 2023 100-meter world champions. 
         Lyles won gold in the men's 100 meters in Sunday's final.<br>
          It's the first time Americans have swept the 100-meter world titles since 
        2017 when Bowie and Justin Gatlin both topped the podium in the event in London.
