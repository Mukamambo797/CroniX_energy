		  Zara Chabby found himself surrounded by the fervor emanating from his
		  disciples, whose excitement mirrored the widespread recognition he had 
		  gained across the globe.</p> 
		  
		  <p> 
		  Regardless of his whereabouts, crowds gathered,
		  eager to absorb his wisdom. The burden of this acclaim, however, became
		  oppressive, propelling Zara Chabby to seek solace in the expansive
		  solitude of the desert—an environment he held dear, a solitude he
		  yearned for.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  Committed to maintaining silence during this desert 
		  sojourn,
		  he roamed aimlessly through the ever-shifting sands.

Nights came and went in the timeless expanse of the desert.
 Seeking refuge beneath cautious shade during scorching days and under
 the moon's brilliance at night, Zara Chabby sustained himself not with food 
 but with the ceaseless thoughts that raced through his mind.
</p>
<p> On the fifth day,
 seated beneath the sheltering catai shade,
 a peculiar man approached.
 </p>

<p>This stranger appeared out of sync with the contemporary era.
 Impeccably groomed and carrying an air of sophistication, he bore a briefcase and
 surveyed his surroundings with an air of detachment.</p>
<p>
 Glancing at his wristwatch,
 the man approached Zara Chabby and, without a word, seated himself beside the 
 silent sage.
