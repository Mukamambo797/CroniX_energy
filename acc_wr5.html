            <h2>Victoria Falls Bridge</h2>
            <div class="blog3">
                <p> The Victoria Falls Bridge crosses the Zambezi River just below the Victoria
                    Falls and is built over the Second Gorge of the falls. As the river forms the border
                    between Zimbabwe and Zambia,<br> the bridge links the two countries and has border posts
                    on the approaches
                    to both ends, at the towns of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, and Livingstone, Zambia.</p>
                <h2> History</h2>
                <p> The bridge was the brainchild of Cecil Rhodes, part of his grand and unfulfilled Cape to Cairo
                    railway scheme, even though he never visited the falls and died before construction of the bridge
                    began. Rhodes is recorded as instructing the engineers to "build the bridge across the Zambezi where
                    the trains, as they pass, will catch the spray of the Falls".[4] It was designed by George Andrew
                    Hobson of consultants Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, assisted by the stress calculations of Ralph
                    Freeman, who was later the principal designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The main central arch is
                    a parabolic curve.[5][6][2][7]

                    The bridge was prefabricated in England by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company, before being
                    shipped to the port city of Beira in Portuguese-ruled Mozambique, and then transported on the newly
                    constructed railway to the Victoria Falls. </p>
                <p> It took just 14 months to construct and was completed in 1905.

                    The bridge was officially opened by Professor Sir George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin and President
                    of the British Association (now the British Science Association), on 12 September 1905. The American
                    Society of Civil Engineers has designated the bridge as an <br> International Historic Civil
                    Engineering Landmark.[1]
                </p>

                </section>

                <p> Constructed from steel, the bridge is 198 metres (650 ft) long, with a main arch spanning 156.50
                    metres (513.5 ft), at a height of 128 metres (420 ft) above the lower water mark of the river in the
                    gorge below. It carries a road, railway and footway.</p>
                <p> The bridge is the only rail link between Zambia and Zimbabwe and one of only three road links
                    between the two countries.</p>

                    <h3> </h3>
                    <p> <span style="font-size: 80px;font-weight: 600; color: blue;"> H</span>ow many people have you
                        spoken with today? Chances are that most of them lied to you—and
                        that they did it more than once.
                        It’s a hard fact to accept, but even your closest friends and coworkers lie to you regularly.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>People lie in everyday conversation to appear more likeable and competent. While men and women
                        lie equally as often, they tend to lie for different reasons. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>1. They cover their mouths.</h4>

                    <p>People often cover their mouths when lying. A hand on the mouth or even a touch of
                        the lips shows you that they are lying because this unconscious body language represents a
                        closing off of communication. When lying, people also instinctively cover vulnerable body parts,
                        such as the head, neck, or abdomen,
                        because lying makes them feel exposed, vulnerable, and open to attack. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>2. They repeat themselves and provide too much detail. </h4>
                    <p> Liars hate silence, so they often try to fill it up by talking more than they need to. They
                        provide far more information than was needed or asked for. Sometimes the longer you stay quiet
                        the more details liars will throw in to support their story as they try to convince you and
                        themselves of their deception. Liars will also repeat phrases over and
                        over again as they struggle to buy time to gather their thoughts.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4> 3. They prepare for an escape. </h4>

                    <p> In an unconscious attempt to find an escape route, people who are lying often angle their bodies
                        toward the door if they’re sitting, and if they’re standing, they may even move closer to the
                        door. They may also change their posture from relaxed to erect or guarded as their
                        bodies perk up in unconscious preparation for an escape.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4> 4. Their words and body language don’t match.</h4>
                    <p> It’s easy to lie with words, but our bodies know (and show) the truth. A clear sign that someone
                        is lying to you is when their words are saying one thing and their body language is saying
                        something entirely different. For example, someone is telling you a sad story about the personal
                        struggles that made them miss work, yet they’re smiling while they’re talking and their hand
                        gestures and body posture are animated and excited.

                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>5. Their breathing changes. </h4>
                    <p>People reflexively start breathing more heavily when they lie as lying causes changes to heart
                        rate and blood flow. Sometimes liars will even have trouble speaking as the mucous membranes
                        in the mouth dry out as part of the body’s response to lying. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4> 6. They change their typical patterns of eye movement.</h4>
                    <p>They say that the eyes are the “windows to the soul.” That’s especially true when someone is
                        lying. But there’s a catch: it’s not where the person is looking that matters, but a change in
                        direction. Some people, for instance, look up and to the right when they’re remembering
                        information, but down when they’re lying. For other people, it’s the opposite. </p>
                    <p>
                        A change in eye movement can be a very strong indicator of lying, but you have to know the
                        person’s typical pattern first. That makes this tactic more suitable to use with people you know
                        well, or at least, interact with on a regular basis. However, there is one eye movement “tell”
                        that’s pretty universal: people who are
                        lying often look toward the door, their unconscious
                        escape route. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4> 7. They get aggressive. </h4>
                    <p> Liars will often get aggressive in a conversation for no apparent reason.
                        Sometimes liars will become hostile and point aggressively in your direction.
                        Other times liars will maintain excessive eye contact without blinking,
                        in an abrasive attempt to appear truthful.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4> 8. They fidget.</h4>
                    <p> Fidgeting is a clear sign of nervous energy. Even practiced liars worry that you won’t
                        believe them, so they release that nervous energy by playing with their hair, tapping their feet
                        or fingers, pulling on their ears, and more. Shuffling the feet is a common expression of
                        nervous energy associated with lying. The feet start
                        moving because the liar feels vulnerable and the body wants to flee.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h4>Bringing It All Together </h4>
                    <p>Before rushing to any conclusions, be certain to consider what constitutes normal behavior
                        for the person who you think might be lying to you. The indicators above only have meaning
                        in the context of a person’s typical behavior. If your colleague has ADHD and fidgets
                        constantly,
                        you can’t take the fidgeting as a sign of lying.
                    </p>
                    <p> And some people, such as psychopaths, don’t
                        demonstrate these behaviors because they don’t feel nervous or guilty about lying. One British
                        study showed that the incidence of psychopathy among CEOs is four times that of the general
                        population,
                        so it’s not as unlikely as you might think. </p>

                <h2>Oxford's Word of the Year for 2023 is...</h2>
                <p><b> Each year, Oxford University Press chooses a word or expression
                        that has reflected the last 12 months and has potential to have lasting cultural significance
                        or provides a snapshot into history. And this year's word is...</b> </p>
                <div class="blog3">
                    <h2> </h2>
                    <p> Do you have rizz and you didn't know it?
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        Oxford University Press, the publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, has named “rizz” the
                        Word of the Year for 2023.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rizz, a widely used word online, is defined as style, charm or attractiveness,
                        or one’s ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner.</p>
                    <p> The word is believed to be a shortened form of the word charisma, taken from the middle part of
                        the word. Rizz can also be used as a verb:
                        to “rizz up” means to attract, seduce or chat up a person.</p>

                    <p> Members of the public voted on social media to narrow down the shortlist of words chosen by the
                        experts. This year’s picks included rizz, Swiftie, beige flag,
                        prompt, heat dome, de-influencing, situationship and parasocial.</p>
                    <p> 2022's Oxford Word of the Year was "goblin mode", another slang term describing
                        "unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy" behaviour.</p>

                        <h2>Rising Temperature, Dry Spells: How Dubai Created Artificial Rain With Cloud Seeding </h2>
                        <p> As reports keep pouring in about the havoc created by monsoon in some parts of India, Dubai
                            just conjured up some rainfall for itself. Using a new method of cloud seeding in which they
                            charged clouds with electricity, this city in the United Arab Emirates found some respite
                            after battling temperatures over 50 degree Celsius. Cloud seeding has been around for some
                            time now and has been employed in India on multiple occasions to mitigate drought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Explaining the process, Kondala Murali Mohan, a scientist with Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Medak),
                            said: “Cloud seeding is a process to create artificial rain. Here, chemicals like silver
                            iodide, potassium iodide and dry ice are sent to the atmosphere through helicopters or
                            planes. These particles attract the water vapour in the air, leading to the formation of
                            cumulonimbus clouds and finally rain. It generally takes half-an-hour to produce rainfall by
                            this method. The time taken to generate rain depends on which portion of the cloud the
                            chemicals
                            are being injected into. Zapping the top layers gives the fastest results.”</p>
                        <h3>HARMFUL EFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENT </h3>
                        <p> However, these experiments are harmful to the environment. The scientist added: “The method
                            can lead to acidification of the oceans, ozone layer depletion and an increase in the levels
                            of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Silver is a heavy, toxic metal and it harms the health of
                            plants, humans and animals. Cloud seeding is also a costly method.
                            A foot of rainfall costs around USD 200.”</p>
                        <p> With so many side-effects, is the process worth it? “India is an agricultural country. When
                            there are droughts and standing crops in the fields, cloud seeding can help to bring some
                            respite. But it is not advisable in the long run,” said Murali.

                            Throwing more light on this method to manipulate the climate, weather blogger Sai Praneeth
                            B, who goes by the name ‘Andhra Pradesh Weatherman’ on Twitter, said: “Clouds start
                            precipitating at a point called Lifted Condensation Level.
                        </p>
                        <p> In cloud seeding, chemicals like silver iodide and hygroscopic salts are used as catalysts
                            to reach that level. After that, the cloud molecules coalesce to form bigger ones that lead
                            to rainfall. Recently, such experiments were carried out at Rayalaseema region in Andhra
                            Pradesh and Karnataka.”</p>

                                        spend time on the lunar surface, you’ll need to know exactly how long it will
                                        take to
                                        get there.</p>

                                        While we’re a ways off building bases on the Moon, NASA’s Artemis mission is
                                        taking people
                                        back onto the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972. The aim

                                        as a staging post for future trips to the Moon</p>
                                    <p>Artemis 3 is set to bring people back onto the Moon for the first time in over 50
                                        years. This mission is likely to take place in 2026 at the earliest – but how
                                        long will it take the astronauts to get to the Moon?

                                        Read on to find out how far away the Moon is from the Earth, how long it takes
                                        to get to the Moon, how long it took Apollo 11, and how long it takes a probe to

                                        The Moon doesn’t have a fixed distance away from the Earth. Just as the Earth’s
                                        orbit isn’t 100 per cent circular around the Sun, the Moon’s orbit isn’t around
                                        the Earth. It gets closer and further away over time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Moon is 363,104km from Earth at its closest point (perigee) and 405,696km
                                        away at its farthest (apogee). Taking these measurements, the average distance
                                        between the Earth and the Moon is around 384,400km.

                                        The elliptical nature of the Moon’s orbit of the Earth is just one of many
                                        factors scientists need to take into account when planning missions up there.

                                        and Michael Collins 75 hours and 49 minutes to get to and land on the Moon.
                                        That’s just over
                                        three days. This is the time it took for them to actually land on the Moon, not
                                        just entering its
