<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 

As Zara-Chabby followed the sound of the cry, he encountered two women walking together, engaged in lively conversation. They noticed his presence and one of them spoke with a hint of mockery, complimenting his appearance while questioning his purpose.
"Do you seek truth, Zara-Chabby?" she taunted, her words laced with sarcasm. The other woman chimed in, jesting about the necessity of a net to catch truth.
Zara-Chabby, ever composed, acknowledged the women with a polite smile. 
 <p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 

He recognized their playful banter and saw an opportunity for a different kind of exchange.
"Lovely ladies," he addressed them respectfully, "it is unwise to wander these paths without the guidance of a monk, wouldn't you agree?"
The women chuckled, finding Zara-Chabby's words refreshing compared to the monk's teachings..

</p>

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
he women chuckled, finding Zara-Chabby's words refreshing compared to the monk's teachings.
"Zara-Chabby, you have said many things. Do you have something in store for us?" asked the woman on the left.
Zara-Chabby laughed, understanding their curiosity. 

</p>




     <section class="chap"> 
        <div class="chap1">
<p style="color: black;font-size: 20px;">
"Indeed, I have much to share, but sometimes silence can be an answer in itself."
</p>
</div>
</section>

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;">The women laughed again, finding his response intriguing and engaging. </p>

<section class="chap"> 
    <div class="chap1">

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size: 20px;">
"We have heard what the monk means to a woman, but what does a woman mean to a monk?" the woman on the left inquired, genuinely interested.
"One must only speak of women with a monk, it is the way of things," replied Zara-Chabby.
 </p>
</div>
</section>


<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> 
"We are mere fragmevts, and our time here is fleeting. We will soon forget what you say," added the woman on the right.
Zara-Chabby agreed, recognizing the transient nature of their encounter.
 He began to speak, capturing their attention with his words.
</p>



<section class="chap"> 
    <div class="chap1">

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> "With the monk, there is madness, yet there is always a method in that madness," 
he began. 
"It is the woman's duty to decipher this madness, to understand and help bring 
clarity to it. But often, the woman herself has her own madness to grapple with.
"With the woman, there is a riddle, and the answer to this riddle is a dance," <br>  he continued. 
</p>



<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> "Everything becomes possible with a woman, and thus the monk must first contemplate every possibility. 
 The woman may not comprehend the concept of duty, but I implore her never to settle for being second in love."
"Zara-Chabby knows this because Zara-Chabby was once loved," he revealed.
"And I would advise her, if she wishes to be loved, to be lovable herself," 
he added with a touch of sincerity.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;"> The two women grew quiet, deeply captivated by Zara-Chabby's words. 
They sensed the weight of his brief speech and recognized its profound impact.
"Zara-Chabby may have spoken few words, but their significance cannot be measured," 
remarked the woman on the left, acknowledging the depth of his wisdom.
</p>

<p style="color: azure;font-size: 20px;" > 
And so, the encounter with the two women left an impression on Zara-Chabby, 
just as his words resonated with them. Each carried a piece of the exchange within them,
continuing their journeys with newfound contemplation and understanding.
