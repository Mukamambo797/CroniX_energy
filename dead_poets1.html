<h2>Let’s Play Pretend</h2>


<div class="poet2">  

  <p>         Let’s pretend you’re a complete stranger.       </p>  
  <p>    Let’s pretend our hearts don’t long to be with each other even though we’re so far apart.          </p> 
   <p>    Let’s pretend my heart doesn’t race at the thought of your name.      </p> 
  




<p>        We can pretend but you and I both know it only makes the pain worse.      </p> 

<p>        Pain we try so hard to ignore but we can’t because it seems to be the only thing keeping us going.      </p> 

<p>        Could we pretend all our feelings were make believe?      </p> 

<p>     That they were just tales meant to be left in the pages of a child’s story book.         </p> 

 <p>         That I could not be your princess who simply fell in love with one look.     </p> 

<p>    Oh no, clearly our story is far greater than that of Captain Hook.          </p> 

<p>     Can we pretend you’re made for someone else?         </p> 

<p>        That you have eyes only for her and my heart doesn’t break every time you say her name.      </p> 

<p>         Can we pretend we live in a world where I’m happy and you’re not even a thought that crosses my mind?     </p> 

<p>        If all this were true it would be easier for me to walk around blind.      </p> 

<p>     If all this were true, you wouldn’t be back again after telling me you found the love of your life.         </p> 

<p>     Seeing you and her felt like being stabbed over and over with a knife.         </p> 

<p>  I    t’s never easy to walk away, but how do I walk away when we’re both not ready to let go?     </p> 

<p>    How do I let go when you constantly text me just when I think it’s over?          </p> 

<p>  Let’s play pretend.            </p> 

<p>       Let’s pretend we’re just friends because strangers is too far apart.       </p> 

<p>         Let’s pretend you’re happy to see me with him.     </p> 

<p>         Let’s pretend our friendship isn’t just a way to stay in each other’s lives from a distance.     </p>       



 <p>  Let’s pretend because pretending is clearly all we’re good at doing.</p>

                   <p> Once upon a time, always wondered why every story started with that line </p>
                   <p>once upon a time he said it like he could see time. </p>
                  <p>          He said I was young and in love I worshiped her just like a minion I was to blind to see that she was more than a villain <br> despite her making me cry like an onion</p>   
                  <p>  …. say once upon a time once upon a time. once upon a time he always</p>
                <p>  said it while sipping on wine, once upon a time, he said it like he would see time </p>
                 <p> Once upon the reversal of time when the world stripped him off his manhood it was during his childhood that he never </p>
                  <p> really understood the value of being prince and so he wanted to quickly ascend the thrown without the wisdom of the kingdom.</p>
                 <p> But once upon a time life is not a play he got to dictate instead it’s a series of scenes that come about as a result of his choices.</p>
                 <p>   He always had the option to heal when he had been hurt cause it’s no use hurting because he had been hurt.  </p>
                  <p>   every choice he made was perceived as right to those behind him and before he realized it was a series of hurt people hurting people.</p>
                  <p>    And as he took a last sip of his wine, he remembers that life is no fairy tale but his story had just ended with once upon a time.</p>

  <h2> TIME TIME TIME  </h2>
 <p> Time is sleeping on my watch,
Time is slipping on my watch.
Slow and steady, I wish its hands could be quickened,
To the next hour or minute,
Where in, my pain can not be experienced.

Fast and shaky, I wish this present moment ticked more than a day long,
So I can gyrate to my positive vibrations,
Write a song, maybe a poem,
Take a promenade with them who freeze time, imprinting vivid memories onto my mind’s canvas, 

But the hands of time are constrained, the least it could provide 
Is a hand full of experience.

Time is a pandora box,
Every one of it’s hands is curious,
Curious as the sun, to shine on a rainy day
Curious as a child eager to tread the earth,
Curious as the moon waxing in full strength 
Curious as Life taking shape
Curious as death!

Curiosity furthers a thought,
What if we lived outside of time?
Well then we would be God,
Perhaps we can, yes on a blessed day,
When Time shall be no more.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<p>Because the setting sun does so well to bid us farewell in its gentle glare we see a beauty there, as the sky is lit and the horizon is transformed with splendor, what i notice there is a cry . One filled with grandeur and applause, appreciation for the act the world puts on as the day peeks into the still laying splendor of the night , the sun steps into the darkness to play and finds Gods creature at play, Man so lost yet so proud. It can only offer those moments it lights up the sky and in them we see beauty, fear , praise and the ugly yet still in the vision of day , And as the night will come, our dreams are lit still by the Fragile memories that we share with the light (the SUN) Who could ever sing the orchestra of our chaos and the melodies of our victories ? Life is a brief moment when you see it on a person you are never sure until the person can see it on you . But still its never too clear Maybe because we relied more on knowledge of love and not on LIFE love , Still separate</p>
